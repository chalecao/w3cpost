It is used for tracking changes in the source code during software development. It was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system kernel. Git is an efficient distributed VCS tool that can handle projects from small to very large ones providing cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.</description></item><item><title>version-control-system</title><link>/git/basic/version-control-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/git/basic/version-control-system/</guid><description>Version Control # Definition # Version control is a system that allows the software team to manage changes to the source code over time. This software tool makes it easier for developers to collaborate on different projects separating their tasks through branches. It also gives the possibility to turn back to earlier versions for comparing and fixing the mistakes if needed.
Importance # The points mentioned above are especially important for developer-oriented work, as it enables multiple developers or teams to work separately without having an impact on the work of others.</description></item></channel></rss>
